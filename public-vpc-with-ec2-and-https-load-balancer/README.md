This example is pretty much exactly the same as 
"ec2-with-elastic-ip-and-https-load-balancer" except that instead of using the 
default VPC, we are creating a new one.

1. Deploys everything within a VPC
1. Sets up networking so that servers deployed within the VPC have access to the
   internet and can still be hit directly, so the VPC is more of a "container" 
   to group all AWS resources, rather than providing any kind of extra security
1. Deploys a single EC2 server within the VPC
1. Deploys a load balancer that
    - redirects HTTP to HTTPS
    - uses an SSL certificate assigned based on ARN of existing certificate provided in variables
    - terminates the HTTPS connection and forwards on the plain HTTP request interanally to the EC2 server.
    

This example is good for when one is deploying a service, but needs to allow a 
third party to easily update/manage the SSL certificates (swap them out on the 
load balancer through the AWS console). We set up port forwarding so that
we can still access the EC2 via SSH. This setup requires only one public 
elastic IP, no matter how many EC2 servers one has.
